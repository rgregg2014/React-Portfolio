# REACT Portfolio

## Description

This project builds a single-page portfolio website with React. It includes my "About Me", "Project" and "Contact" information. As opposed to an earlier project, which relies on HTML and CSS with a framework, this portfolio demonstrates competence with a modern JavaScript library: React.
