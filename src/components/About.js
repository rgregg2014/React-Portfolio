      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Rachel, thanks for stopping by! I'm a web developer based in
        Buffalo, NY. In 2014, I graduated the State University of New York at
        Fredonia, Magna Cum Laude, with a Bachelor of Science in Communications
        and Media Studies. After school, I spent time in film and television
        while living in Atlanta, GA. After returning to Buffalo, I took over
        management of a local movie theatre, honing my leadership and business
        management skills.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        With an aptitude with complex design softwares and an educational
        background in media communications, the move into web design and
        development felt like a natural evolution of my skills.
